# Portfolio

 - View my website [here](https://abdishakury.github.io/)

Compilation of personal and online courses projects. This portfolio, as a whole, aims to demonstrate proven experience in Data Science principals including obtaining/cleaning data, building **Extract, Transform, Load,** (ETL) pipelines, **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) and, building and validating **Machine Learning** models.

## [Building Energy Usage Model](https://github.com/sergatron/ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III)
#### Feb 2020 – Mar 2020
Project descriptionThis competition aims to build counterfactual models to predict buildings' energy usage. A successful model should scale well and minimize the Root Mean Squared Log Error. Counterfactual models are estimates of energy usage before any improvements are made within the building. This estimate is then compared with the actual energy usage after the improvements to calculate energy usage and confirm that the improvements are in fact working.


## [Article Recommendations](https://github.com/Abdishakury/recommendations_with_IBM)
#### Jan 2020
This project focuses on analyzing interactions between users and articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. New article recommendations are made to users based on their interactions with articles. Based on the data available, we can use various methods to make these recommendations. The methods used here are Rank Based, Collaborative Filtering, and Matrix Factorization.


## [Disaster Response Pipeline](https://github.com/Abdishakury/abdishakur-disaster-response)
#### Nov 2019
 - Utilized frameworks such as ***NLTK*** and ***Scikit-Learn*** to perform ETL, build ML pipeline, and deploy ML model to a local web application.
 - The ML pipeline processes 26,000 raw text messages using NLTK and Scikit-Learn to build a multioutput classification model.
 - Maximized F1 score through feature engineering and parameter tuning.


## [Predicting the Cost of a Solar Array Installation](https://github.com/sergatron/projects/tree/master/solar_array)
#### May 2019 – Jul 2019
 - Analysis revealed a trend of declining national average installation costs of about 30% since 2009 peak.
 - Predicted the cost of a residential solar panel array using a ML pipeline built using Scikit-Learn.
 - Evaluated multiple regression models (Ridge, RandomForest, GradientBoosting) and optimized the pipeline to minimize the RMSE and MAE.


## [Data Dashboards](https://github.com/sergatron/data-dashboard)
#### Oct 2019
Dashboards developing using ***Flask***, ***Plotly***, ***Pandas*** and ***NumPy***. Using data acquired from [WorldBank](https://data.worldbank.org/), it is cleaned and transformed into usable form using Pandas framework. Flask is used to create a HTML template for visualizations using Plotly. 


## [Face Recognition with OpenCV](https://github.com/sergatron/Coursera/tree/master/open_cv_project)
#### Apr 2019 - May 2019
Scans over a newspaper article and images looking for occurrences of a specified keywords and detecting faces. ***OpenCV*** is used to detect faces, ***tesseract*** to perform optical character recognition and ***PIL*** to put together resulting images onto a new contact sheet.
